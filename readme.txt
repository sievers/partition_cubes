Simple python code to find ways of partioning numbers into even piles.
To run, edit find_target_sum_any_kids.py and set nkids to be the
desired number of children to partition the sum of cubes evenly
between, and then do 'python3 find_target_sum_any_kids.py'.
Incidentally, the same code can be used to (very slowly!) search for
partitions of higher-dimensional spheres by changing ndim in the code.
